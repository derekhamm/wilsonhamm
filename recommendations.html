            <h1>East Nashville</h1>
        <p>We’re biased, but it’s our favorite part of town.</p>
        <p>If you’re getting in on Friday, check out Lyra for dinner. They have a great happy hour and it’s where we went the night we got engaged! Cafe Roze, Folk, and Lockeland Table are all favorites but note that Nashville on a Friday night is going to require a reservation. If you’re feeling more low-key, Smith & Lentz Brewery is the perfect pizza and beer choice.</p>
        <p>If you’re not ready to call it a night, try your hand at some pinball at No Quarter, where Jarod has not one high score. We also frequent Inglewood Lounge for cocktails or Dukes for a late-night sandwich (get the chips tricked!).</p>
        <p>On Saturday, start off with some breakfast from Hearts; the home of Emilee’s favorite pancakes. If you’re looking for something a little quicker, grab some coffee and kolaches from Yeast Nashville where Jarod used to wash dishes.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking to get outside, we frequent the Shelby Bottoms Greenway and the Cornelia Fort Airpark (the perfect spot to break out your blades!).</p>
        <p>Lunch has a theme- it’s tacos. Mas Tacos and Red Headed Stranger are two of our most visited spots and we will not choose one over the other- you can’t make us. Just pick one and enjoy!</p>
        <p>For some good East Nashville shopping, check out the Shops on Fatherland; including Gift Horse and Tenn Gallon Hat for some fun Tennessee souvenirs. From there, you can walk down to Five Points where there is plenty to explore. A couple of other frequent stops include Flora, Thundermoon Collective, and The Good Fill. Yes, this is just a list of places Emilee spends money.</p>
        <p>Grab a coffee at Crema for your afternoon pick-me-up before you head out for the wedding. We will see you at 5:00!</p>
