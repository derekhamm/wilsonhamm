            <h3>East Nashville</h3>
            <p>We’re biased, but it’s our favorite part of town.</p>
            <h4>If you’re getting in on Friday, check out Lyra for dinner. They have a great happy hour and it’s where we went the night we got engaged! <a id="recommendations" href="https://www.caferoze.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Roze</a>, Folk, and Lockeland Table are all favorites but note that Nashville on a Friday night is going to require a reservation. If you’re feeling more low-key, Smith & Lentz Brewery is the perfect pizza and beer choice.</h4>
            <h4>If you’re not ready to call it a night, try your hand at some pinball at No Quarter, where Jarod has not one high score. We also frequent Inglewood Lounge for cocktails or Dukes for a late-night sandwich (get the chips tricked!).</h4>
            <h4>On Saturday, start off with some breakfast from Hearts; the home of Emilee’s favorite pancakes. If you’re looking for something a little quicker, grab some coffee and kolaches from Jarod's former employer, Yeast Nashville. If you’re looking to get outside, we frequent the Shelby Bottoms Greenway and the Cornelia Fort Airpark (the perfect spot to break out your blades!).</h4>
            <h4>Lunch has a theme- it’s tacos. Mas Tacos and Red Headed Stranger are two of our most visited spots and we will not choose one over the other - you can’t make us. Just pick one and enjoy!</h4>
            <h4>For some good East Nashville shopping, check out the Shops on Fatherland; including Gift Horse and Tenn Gallon Hat for some fun Tennessee souvenirs. From there, you can walk down to Five Points where there is plenty to explore. A couple of other frequent stops include Flora, Thundermoon Collective, and The Good Fill. Yes, this is just a list of places Emilee spends money. Grab a coffee at Crema for your afternoon pick-me-up before you head out for the wedding.</h4>
            <p>We will see you at 5:00!</p>

            <h3>Downtown Nashville</h3>
            <h4>CMA Fest is going on this weekend so if large crowds and country music are your jam, head on over to downtown Music City and take it all in. If they're not, we do not recommend.</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="main-column">
            <h3>Not Nashville</h3>
            <h4>If you are staying in Murfreesboro, we recommend checking out the Alley on Main for dinner. It’s a great local spot for hot chicken and fun cocktails. You also can’t go wrong with Slim and Husky's; it’s right near the Hyatt and a Nashville original. For an after-dinner drink, check out Mayday Brewery. If you see the bride’s parents, buy them a beer!</h4>
            <h4>On Saturday, pack a lunch and head out to Arrington Vineyards. There is plenty of space to lay out a blanket and listen to some live music while you try some local wine.</h4>
            <h4>If you are traveling with children, get a day pass to Lucky Ladd Farms for what we are told is endless fun.</h4>
